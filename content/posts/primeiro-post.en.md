## First Post

Welcome to my blog!
This is the first post, where I aim to document my research, projects, and share topics that interest me.

### What to expect from this blog?

In this space, you will find:

- **Experiences**: Stories about learnings and research I've done.
- **Tutorials and tips**: Guides on tools, programming languages, and other things I use.
- **Personal projects**: Updates and behind-the-scenes of my parallel projects.

I hope you enjoy the content and keep an eye on the news.
The blog is officially launched!
